					<h2 class="to-animate">Why you need MelGo? </h2>

					<p>There's something incredibly soothing about coming home after a dull day at work and being
						welcomed with wet kisses. For many people, interacting with a pet is the ultimate antidote
						to a
						tense day.
					</p>

					<p>"Interacting with a pet can increase oxytocin, beta-endorphin and dopamine levels as well as
						reduce cortisol levels — powerful neurochemicals that can lower our blood pressure and make
						us
						feel happier, better and more relaxed," says Rebecca A. Johnson, a professor at the
						University
						of Missouri College of Veterinary Medicine, "and positive response can occur by just looking
						at
						the animal".
					</p>

					<p>Oxytocin, often called the "love" or "trust" hormone because of the feelings it triggers when
						we
						kiss or fall in love, also promotes social bonding.
					</p>

					</div>

					<p>Does that include watching cute animal videos or live streaming?
					</p>

					<p>"Yes," says neuroeconomist Paul Zak, a professor at Claremont Graduate University. "Watching
						YouTube videos about animals can induce oxytocin release causing us to engage in helping
						animals
						or people."
					</p>

					<p>Search YouTube for cat or dog videos, and you'll find both over 900 million results; that's
						more
						than you'll find for public figures, like Taylor Swift or Donald Trump, or even other
						emblems of
						cuteness, like human babies.
					</p>

					<p>In one Indiana University’s Media School study recruited 6,827 people from the Facebook page
						of
						an animal advocacy group and surveyed them about pet ownership, Internet use, video
						consumption,
						and their personality.
					</p>

					</div>

					<p>In the most exciting part of the study, Jessica Gall Myrick, an assistant professor of
						school,
						asked her users to recall the last time they watched a cat video and record their mood
						before
						and after the viewing. Overwhelmingly, respondents said they felt significantly happier
						after
						watching the videos and experienced fewer negative emotions of anxiety, sadness, and guilt.
					</p>

					<p>In fact, after watching a cat video, people experienced a similar response to playing with a
						therapy cat. “Most of the literature on pet therapy shows that it reduces anxiety and can
						improve people’s mood,” says Myrick.

					<p>According to our Palgo Technical Group, from December 2019 to April 2020, the number of posts
						about #alone on Twitter showed an overall upward trend. Among them, the number of related
						hashtags on April 4 this year was about double that of 4 months ago. It can be seen that during
						this period, more netizens expressed their loneliness and isolation on social media.</p>

					<p>The technical team introduces the twint interface, completes the main function, and crawls to the
						target tweet through the hashtag.</p>

					<p>Between September 2019 and April 2020, the number of posts about #pet adoption on Twitter
						declined slightly overall; the Twitter publishers who viewed the posts roughly were mostly
						animal shelters. business. It also reflects the possibility of the shelter launching online
						interaction with animal lovers, according to the Technical Group.</p>

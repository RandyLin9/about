					<p>There's something incredibly soothing about coming home after a dull day at work and being
						welcomed with wet kisses. For many people, interacting with a pet is the ultimate antidote to a
						tense day.
					</p>

					<p>"Interacting with a pet can increase oxytocin, beta-endorphin and dopamine levels as well as
						reduce cortisol levels — powerful neurochemicals that can lower our blood pressure and make us
						feel happier, better and more relaxed," says Rebecca A. Johnson, a professor at the University
						of Missouri College of Veterinary Medicine, "and positive response can occur by just looking at
						the animal".
					</p>

					<p>Oxytocin, often called the "love" or "trust" hormone because of the feelings it triggers when we
						kiss or fall in love, also promotes social bonding.
					</p>

					<p>Does that include watching cute animal videos or live streaming?
					</p>

					<p>"Yes," says neuroeconomist Paul Zak, a professor at Claremont Graduate University. "Watching
						YouTube videos about animals can induce oxytocin release causing us to engage in helping animals
						or people."
					</p>

					<p>Search YouTube for cat or dog videos, and you'll find both over 900 million results; that's more
						than you'll find for public figures, like Taylor Swift or Donald Trump, or even other emblems of
						cuteness, like human babies.
					</p>

					<p>In one Indiana University’s Media School study recruited 6,827 people from the Facebook page of
						an animal advocacy group and surveyed them about pet ownership, Internet use, video consumption,
						and their personality.

					<p>In the most exciting part of the study, Jessica Gall Myrick, an assistant professor of school,
						asked her users to recall the last time they watched a cat video and record their mood before
						and after the viewing. Overwhelmingly, respondents said they felt significantly happier after
						watching the videos and experienced fewer negative emotions of anxiety, sadness, and guilt.</p>

					<p>In fact, after watching a cat video, people experienced a similar response to playing with a
						therapy cat. “Most of the literature on pet therapy shows that it reduces anxiety and can
						improve people’s mood,” says Myrick.
